I'm broadly interested in machine learning theory and problems at the intersection of optimization, statistics, and theoretical computer science. I recently graduated from MIT with a double major in mathematics (Course 18) and computer science (Course 6-3). In the fall I'll be starting my CS Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, where I'll be supported by an NSF GRFP fellowship.
